### Tech

The following tools are used to teach scalibility.

* [React] - A javascript library for building user interfaces

* [Javascript] - the programming language of HTML and the Web
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework
* [golang] - an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.
* [Docker] - an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications
* [nginx] - high performance load balancer
* [cAdvisor] - provides a pane of glass to look at container resource usage
* [vagrant] - Create and configure lightweight, reproducible, and portable development environments.


### Services
* [AWS] - Amazon web-services
